I sit alone in the dim light of dawn, cradling the edges of a worn-out photograph that whispers tales of a happiness now lost. The room around me feels larger, emptier, as if the very space knows of my solitude. I trace the faces in the photograph with a trembling finger, each curve and line a reminder of a time when laughter filled my days and warmth wasn't just a memory. My heart aches with the weight of missing pieces, people who were once my world, now gone. Tears blur my vision, not just for what was, but for the realization that some voids can never be filled. I'm engulfed in a silence so profound, it drowns every heartbeat, leaving me adrift in a sea of sorrow, yearning for a past that slips further away with each passing moment.
