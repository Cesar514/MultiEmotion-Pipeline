I can't believe you! After everything we've been through, you choose now to turn your back on me? You know how much I needed your support, yet you act as if my struggles are nothing but an inconvenience to you. It's like all our promises, all our plans together, meant absolutely nothing. I've been bending over backwards, trying to keep this thing afloat, and you? You just walk away without a second thought, leaving me to pick up the pieces. Well, guess what? I'm done. I'm done trying to hold onto something that's clearly broken. You've shown your true colors, and I can't unsee them. I'm angry, yes, but more than that, I'm disappointed. Disappointed that I ever thought you were different.
